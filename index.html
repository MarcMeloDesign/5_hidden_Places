			The Ledge is a favorite hiking spot for locals. Featuring
			trails and streams and an iconic 40 ft. ledge. It is located 
			within the Freetown/Fallriver state forest. Also an area well 
			known to be haunted. Even the Indains who lived there orignally
			would not goto that area. And to be fair there has been many cult
			sitings and murders over the decades but it is a notable area 
			worth exploring I personnally have never experienced anything 
			negative there.
